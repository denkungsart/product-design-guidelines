# Typography

`Status: Draft` · `Owner: [name]`

Filmmakers System uses Bootstrap's typography and its type tokens. Anything not defined on this page follows sizes, line heights and the naming conventions from Bootstrap — this page does not repeat them.

---

## Families

We use Bootstrap's native font stack unmodified — the OS picks the best available face.

## Scale

### Heading roles

Heading sizes MUST use Bootstrap's existing size utilities. Use the following sizes for each role; do not introduce a custom heading scale.

| Heading role | Class | Size | Weight |
|---|---|---|---|
| Page title | `.fs-2xl` | 28–32px | 600 |
| Section heading | `.fs-lg` | 18–20px | 600 |
| Card or group heading | `.fs-md` | 16px | 600 |

Pixel values assume `1rem = 16px`. The ranges follow Bootstrap's responsive size tokens and vary with viewport width.

Heading elements (`h1`–`h6`) MUST reflect the document structure. Use the size utility to express the visual role independently of the heading level. For example, a page title can use `<h1 class="fs-2xl fw-semibold">Project details</h1>`.

| Body | Size | Weight | Usage |
|---|---|---|---|
| body large | 1rem / 16px | 400 | Anything the user reads in paragraphs, however not for user-entered reference descriptions (e.g. project or role descriptions within a caster's own project)|
| **body** | **0.875rem / 14px** | **400** | **Default. Anything the user scans, operates, or fills in** |
| caption | 0.75rem / 12px | 400 | Tooltips, timestamps, legal |

**12px is the floor**. MUST NOT use it for anything the user must read to complete a task.

**Express secondary importance with colour, not size.** Dropping from 14px to 12px to signal
"less important" is the most common way this scale gets broken. Use `--bs-secondary-color`
at the same size instead.

MUST NOT use italics for emphasis; use weight 600. Exception: user-written rich text (e.g. a Project description) keeps the italics its author added.

## Weights

A system stack gives no control over which weights are installed, so the scale uses two.

| Weight | Class | Use |
|---|---|---|
| 400 | `.fw-normal` | Body copy, table cells, descriptions, input values — the default |
| 600 | `.fw-semibold` | Headings, buttons, form labels, table column headers, active nav, emphasis |

**MUST NOT use `.fw-medium` / `font-weight: 500`.** Segoe UI on Windows 10 ships no Medium face,
so 500 falls back to Regular and renders identically to body text. Where existing code or designs use `.fw-medium` / `font-weight: 500` replace it with `.fw-semibold` / `font-weight: 600` to ensure the emphasis remains.

**MUST NOT express de-emphasis with weight.** Use colour instead. Lighter-than-body weights are not
reliably available. Use `--bs-secondary-color` at 400.

## Accessibility

- **Critical:** Set `--bs-body-font-size: var(--bs-font-size-sm)` in the central Bootstrap adapter to select the 14px `body` default. Do not shrink the document root to achieve this. Changing the body default does not rescale Bootstrap's independent named sizes or headings. Browser font-size preferences and 200% text zoom (WCAG 2.1 AA, SC 1.4.4) MUST remain supported.
- Body copy MUST NOT be justified. Uneven word spacing makes it harder to read for users with dyslexia.
- All-caps MUST NOT be used for anything longer than a short label.
- Line length limit: MUST NOT exceed 80 characters per WCAG advisory guidelines (Guideline 1.4.8).

## Unresolved

### Open decisions

*None yet.*

### Watching

- Do we need to add an option for `.fw-bold` / `font-weight: 700`

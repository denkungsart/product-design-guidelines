## How the sources work together

This repository is the product-policy layer, not a replacement for Bootstrap or the application itself.

<ol class="source-order">
  <li><div><strong>Production frontend</strong><span>Defines the components and tokens that actually exist.</span></div></li>
  <li><div><strong>Product guidelines</strong><span>Define which supported options to use, when to use them, and why.</span></div></li>
  <li><div><strong>Bootstrap 6</strong><span>Provides implementation behaviour and defaults where product guidance is silent.</span></div></li>
</ol>

## A living reference

The Markdown in this repository powers both this human-readable site and the instructions used by AI agents. As product decisions are reviewed, the same source is updated for everyone.
